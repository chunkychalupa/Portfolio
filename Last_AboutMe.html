      <div class="col-sm-8"><p> Hi, my name is Catherine Mah. I am a student at Dublin High School and am 15 years old. I grew up in San Jose, CA, until my family decided to move to Dublin, CA when I was in kindergarten.</br></br>
One major accomplishment of mine is being able to have the experience of being club president in middle school. The club was called Fallon4Change. Being a club president exposed me to leadership skills, being able to lead and help people. A quote that inspires me to keep going is, “Leaders instill in their people a hope for success and a belief in themselves. Positive leaders empower people to accomplish their goals.” -Unknown              </br>                          
</br>
Another accomplishment of mine is keeping up with my grades. This has taught me that consistency is the best thing. If you have a good routine, you can continue doing anything you want. A quote I like is, “Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.” – Dwayne Johnson                                                                    </br>
